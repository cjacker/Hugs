**Hugs (Haskell UserÂ´s Gofer System)** was a popular implementation of the Haskell programming language, and had
been used in many books, tutorials as a teaching platform.

The last upstream release was 'Sep2006', and Maintainence was stopped in 2009.

However, it still works quickly and correctly, can be built and installed in few minutes, without requirement to admin privileges, and has less complicated error messages than ghc. 

Especially, the installation size is very tiny comparing to the tremendous ghc.

Here is a fork of the most recent codes with some improvement.

## Improvement comparing to 'Sep2006':
* tweak the build system, make it work with recent tools.
* update haskell base to a decent version; base-4.0
* update essential utilities, include cabal, cpphs, hsc2hs.
* update various hackages
* Bundle 'happy' parser generator
* ...

## build from release:
The release tarball already includes the source codes of haskell base and other packages.

Download: https://github.com/cjacker/Hugs/releases/download/preview/Hugs-May2019.tar.xz

```console
$ autoreconf
$ ./configure 
$ make && make install
```

## build from source:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/cjacker/Hugs
$ cd Hugs
$ ./download-packages.sh
$ autoreconf
$ ./configure 
$ make && make install
```

## Requirements:
* darcs (only needed when build from git, to fetch base-4.0 source code from haskell.org)
* gcc/g++/make/autoconf/perl
* libedit/ncurses with dev package
* libsigsegv with dev package (optional)
* X11 with dev packages (optional, to build hackage: X11)
* OpenAL/FreeALUT with dev package (optional, to build hackages: OpenAL/ALUT)
* OpenGL/FreeGLUT with dev package (optional, to build hackages: OpenGL/GLUT)

## Known issues and TODOs:
* **TODO:** foreign import wrapper not works on x86_64/arm/aarch64.
  + it wasn't implemented by upstream.
  + OpenGL/GLUT on x86_64 broken due to this issue.
* Only tested with linux.
  + codes related to other platform keep untouched, should work but not sure.
* some testcase in bundled 'tests' may broken, the test codes need more tweak.
