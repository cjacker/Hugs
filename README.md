**Hugs (Haskell UserÂ´s Gofer System)** was a popular implementation of the Haskell programming language, and had
been used in many books, tutorial as a teaching platform.

The last upstream release was 'Sep2006', and Maintainence was stopped in 2009.

However, it still works quickly and correctly, can be built and installed quickly without administrator privileges,
and has less complicated error messages than ghc. 

Especially, the installation size is very small comparing to the tremendous ghc.

Here is a fork of the most recent codes with some improvement.

##Improvement comparing to 'Sep2006':
* tweak the build system, make it work with recent tools.
* update haskell base to a decent version; base-4.0
* update essential utilities, include cabal, cpphs, hsc2hs.
* update various hackages
* Bundle 'happy' parser generator
* ...


##build from source:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/cjacker/Hugs
$ cd Hugs
$ ./download-packages.sh
$ autoreconf
$ ./configure 
$ make && make install
```

##Requirements:
* darcs (to fetch base-4.0 source code from haskell.org)
* gcc/g++/make/autoconf/perl
* libedit/ncurses with dev package
* libsigsegv with dev package (optional)
* X11 with dev packages (optional, to build hackage: X11)
* OpenAL/FreeALUT with dev package (optional, to build hackages: OpenAL/ALUT)
* OpenGL/FreeGLUT with dev package (optional, to build hackages: OpenGL/GLUT)

##Known issues and TODOs:
* TODO: foreign import wrapper not works on x86_64/arm/aarch64.
  + it wasn't implemented by upstream.
  + OpenGL/GLUT broken due to this issue.
* Only tested with linux.
* some testcase in bundled 'tests' may broken, the test codes need tweak.
